CP2 User Management Migration
========================

Summary
=======

This is an FAQ about migrating your code to the CP2 version of the Citrine Platform.

What's new?
====================

Teams
-----------

The biggest fundamental change that affects Citrine Python when migrating to CP2 is the
introduction of the Teams concept for access control. In CP2, all projects and assets are owned by
Teams that include one or more users on the platform. This concept was introduced to make it easier
for Citrine Platform users to securely share assets across projects where it makes sense for their
business.
