===============================
Using the Citrine Python Client
===============================

The Citrine python client creates, reads, updates, and deletes :doc:`resources <basic_structure>` using the Citrine product API.

Creating
--------

To create a resource, initialize it as you would any other python object. For example,

.. code-block:: python

    from citrine.resources.process_spec import ProcessSpec
    buy_electrolyte_spec = ProcessSpec("Buy ammonium chloride")

creates a process spec with the display name "Buy ammonium chloride" and no other information.

To persist a resource in the database, you must upload it using the ``register`` command.
The following command uploads this process spec to the dataset ``battery_dataset_1``:

.. code-block:: python

    battery_dataset_1.process_specs.register(buy_electrolyte_spec)

You must specify the dataset, because all process specs are :ref:`associated with a dataset <data-model-objects-label>`, and the collection type, in this case ``.process_specs``.
The command ``battery_dataset_1.material_runs.register(buy_electrolyte_spec)``, which attempts to register a process spec to the collection of material runs, will result in an error.

The ``register`` command returns a copy of the resource as it now exists in the database.
The database may decorate the object with additional information, such as a unique identifier string that you can use to retrieve it in the future.

.. _functionality_reading_label:

Reading
-------

There are several ways to retrieve a resource from the database.

Get
^^^

Get retrieves a specific resource with a known unique identifier string.
If the project ``ceramic_resistors_project`` has a dataset with an id that you have saved as ``special_dataset_id``, then you could retrieve it with:

.. code-block:: python

    ceramic_resistors_project.datasets.get(special_dataset_id)

List
^^^^

List returns an iterator of every resource in a collection.
To list every material spec in the dataset ``standard_glasses_dataset``, use the command:

.. code-block:: python

    standard_glasses_dataset.material_specs.list()

You can instead broaden the scope of the search to an entire project.
The command ``lens_project.material_specs.list()`` will list every material spec in every dataset that ``lens_project`` has read access to.

Updating
--------

The ``register`` command is also used to update an object. The following code creates and persists
a process spec ``sintering`` to a dataset ``tungsten_dataset``, then updates it locally
and persists that update.

.. code-block:: python

    sintering = tungsten_dataset.register(ProcessSpec(name="Sinter a powder"))
    sintering.notes = "Forgot to add notes!"
    tungsten_dataset.register(sintering)


Deleting
--------

Deleting an object is a permanent action and cannot be undone, so do use caution when performing deletes!

In order for a delete to be successful, the following circumstances must be true:

1. The user has write access to the containing dataset
2. Deleting the object won't invalidate or orphan other objects

In the case that a delete fails, an error message will be returned indicating the point of failure.

For example, any attempt to delete a ``MaterialSpec`` object that is referenced by a ``MaterialRun`` object will be unsuccessful because the ``MaterialRun`` would no longer have an associated ``MaterialSpec``.

In this case, an error message will be returned with both the ``id`` of the referencing ``MaterialRun`` object *and* the ``id`` of its containing dataset.
Should that ``MaterialRun`` itself be deleted, or associated with a different ``MaterialSpec`` object, the targeted ``MaterialSpec`` can then be deleted.

Deleting uses this generalized approach:

.. code-block:: python

    dataset.object_type.delete(id)

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    tungsten_dataset.material_specs.delete(id)

Deleting a dataset follows a similar pattern.
In order for the delete to be successful, the dataset must be empty.

.. code-block:: python

    project.datasets.delete(id)

Data Model Object Specific Methods
-----------------------------------

The client supports additional methods on certain data model object resources.

Project-Wide Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Data model objects are each contained in exactly one dataset.
However, most methods that read data model objects can be evaluated against all of the datasets that are readable from a project.
Special data model object collections are available in the project to support this, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    project.material_specs.list()

Any method that writes to a data model object must be taken from within a dataset-scoped collection.

Filter
^^^^^^

Filter lies somewhere between Get and List, returning only those objects that meet a given criterion.
There are currently three ways to filter, and they work on each data model object type:
:func:`~citrine.resources.data_concepts.DataConceptsCollection.filter_by_tags`,
:func:`~citrine.resources.data_objects.DataObjectCollection.filter_by_attribute_bounds`,
and :func:`~citrine.resources.data_concepts.DataConceptsCollection.filter_by_name`.

Filtering by tags or attribute bounds can be scoped to a dataset or to a project.
Filtering by name must be scoped to a dataset.

Get Material History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with a specific root :class:`MaterialRun <citrine.resources.material_run.MaterialRun>`,
you can retrieve the complete material history--every process, ingredient and material that went
into the root material, as well as the measurements that were performed on all of those materials
The method is :func:`~citrine.resources.material_run.MaterialRunCollection.get_history`,
and it requires you to know a unique identifier (scope/id pair) for the material.
