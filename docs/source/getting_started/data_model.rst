Data Model Overview

Overview
--------

The Citrine Python client is built on our data model, GEMD.
GEMD is a format that links together materials, the processes that produced them, and the measurements that characterize them.
Complete documentation of GEMD can be found in the `data model docs <https://citrineinformatics.github.io/gemd-docs/>`_,
and a more thorough discussion of working with data objects in this client can be found in the :doc:`data entry docs <../data_entry>`.
This page presents a broad overview.

The Basic Objects: Processes, Materials, Measurements
-----------------------------------------------------

* A process is an action that creates a material, possibly using some input ingredients.
* A material represents a sample, either physical or virtual.
* A measurement characterizes a sample, either physically or computationally.
* An ingredient is a material and its amount that is used as an input to a process.

The links between objects must be established in a specific direction.
An ingredient specifies both the material it is derived from and the process it is used in.
A process does not specify either its input ingredients or the material it produces.
A material specifies the process that creates it, but does not specify what measurements are done on it or how it is used as an ingredient.
Measurements specify the material that they are performed on.

.. hint::

    First create the process, *then* create the output material, then create any measurements done on that material.
    If the material is used as an ingredient in a subsequent process, first create the new process, then create the ingredient
    that describes the materials role in the process.

We make a first class distinction between intent (specs) and reality (runs).
The same spec can be used to create many runs.
For example, you might create a single material spec for 10 cm silicon wafers and hundreds of associated material runs, one representing each physical sample produced.

It is often expected that a run and its spec will agree with each other, but that is not enforced.
A measurement spec on the silicon wafers might state that the property "mass" is expected to have a value of 36.6 +/- 0.1 grams, but the measurement run on one sample has a value of 37.5 grams.
That is OK and *should* be recorded.
Materials science is messy and reality does not always align with our intent.
That's why we've made our data model flexible.

Attributes
----------

Properties are characteristics of a material that could be measured, e.g., chemical composition, density, yield strength.
Conditions are the environmental variables (typically measured) that may affect a process or measurement: e.g., Temperature, Pressure.
Parameters are the non-environmental variables (typically specified and controlled) that may affect a process or measurement: e.g., oven dial temperature position for a kiln firing, magnification for a measurement taken with a SEM.

Each type of object can be assigned some subset of these attributes.
For example, process specs have optional conditions and parameters but not properties.
For more information, please see the documentation related to each data object.

Templates and Validation
------------------------

Templates provide a controlled vocabulary that establishes what attributes you expect objects to have and what the bounds on those attributes are.
Attribute templates constrain a property, parameter, or condition to be within certain bounds.
Object templates contain a list of attribute templates that a process, material, or measurement may not violate.
If you attempt to upload an object with an attribute value that is outside of its associated bounds, you will receive a detailed error message.

.. note::

    Templates let you put guardrails on your objects, but they are not rigidly constraining.
    An object does *not* need to have an attribute for every one of the attribute templates in its object template.
    An object may have attributes with templates that do not exist in its object template; in fact, it may have attributes with no template at all.

Attribute templates should be narrowly scoped and very permissive.
For example, "Temperature is between 20 and 24 degC" is a bad template: temperature is generic and 20-24 degC is too strict.
"Room temperature during drying is between 0 and 100 degC" is better because it is more specific and contains all reasonable values of room temperature.

LinkByUID
----------

The :class:`~gemd.entity.link_by_uid.LinkByUID` class allows you to reference another data model object by a unique identifier without downloading it first.
This is a common pattern within the data model objects, since many objects contain links to other objects that may have already been registered to the platform.
:class:`~gemd.entity.link_by_uid.LinkByUID` objects can use either the platform's unique identifier or an `alternative identifier`__.

.. _deleting_data_objects_label:

Deleting Data Objects
---------------------

Because data objects are so intertwined with each other, deletion must be done carefully.
In order for a delete to be successful, the following circumstances must be true:

1. The user has write access to the containing dataset
2. Deleting the object won't invalidate or orphan other objects

In the case that a delete fails, an error message will be returned indicating the point of failure.

For example, any attempt to delete a ``MaterialSpec`` object that is referenced by a ``MaterialRun`` object will be unsuccessful because the ``MaterialRun`` would no longer have an associated ``MaterialSpec``.

In this case, an error message will be returned with both the ``id`` of the referencing ``MaterialRun`` object *and* the ``id`` of its containing dataset.
Should that ``MaterialRun`` itself be deleted, or associated with a different ``MaterialSpec`` object, the targeted ``MaterialSpec`` can then be deleted.

Deleting uses this generalized approach:

.. code-block:: python

    dataset.object_type.delete(id)

For example:

.. code-block:: python

    tungsten_dataset.material_specs.delete(id)
