        A generic support class to paginate requests into an iterable of a built object.

        Leaving page and per_page as default values will yield all elements in the
        collection, paginating over all available pages.

        The page fetcher returns an Iterable of subsequent items on every invocation,
        returning an empty iterable when fetching is finished.

        Parameters
        ---------
        page_fetcher: Callable[[Optional[int], int], Tuple[Iterable[dict], str]]
            Fetches the next page of elements
        collection_builder: Callable[[Iterable[dict]], Iterable[ResourceType]]
            Builds each element in the collection into the appropriate resource
        page: int, optional
            The "page" of results to list. Default is to read all pages and yield
            all results.  This option is deprecated.
        per_page: int, optional
            Max number of results to return per page. Default is 100.  This parameter
            is used when making requests to the backend service.  If the page parameter
            is specified it limits the maximum number of elements in the response.
        search_params: dict, Optional
            A dictionary representing the request body to a page_fetcher function. The
            page_fetcher function should have a key word argument "search_params" should it
            pass a request body to the target endpoint. If no search_params are supplied,
            no search_params argument will get passed to the page_fetcher function.
        deduplicate: bool, optional
            Whether or not to deduplicate the yielded resources by their uid.  The default
            is true.

        Returns
        -------
        Iterator[ResourceType]
