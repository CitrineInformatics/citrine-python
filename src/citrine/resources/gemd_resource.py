        The uids of the input data concepts resources are updated with their on-platform uids.

        [ALPHA] Update a particular element of the collection with data validation.

        Update a particular element of the collection, doing a deeper check to ensure that
        the dependent data objects are still with the (potentially) changed constraints
        of this change. This will allow you to make bounds and allowed named/labels changes

        Parameters
        ----------
        model: DataConcepts
            The DataConcepts object.
        dry_run: bool
            Whether to actually update the item or run a dry run of the update operation.

        wait_for_response: bool

            below).
        timeout: float
            How long to poll for the result before giving up. This is expressed in
            (fractional) seconds.
        polling_delay: float
            How long to delay between each polling retry attempt.

        -------
        Optional[UUID]
            If wait_for_response if True, then this call will poll the backend, waiting
            for the eventual job result. In the case of successful validation/update,
            a return value of None is provided unless return_model is True, in which case
            the updated resource is fetched and returned. In the case of a failure
            validating or processing the update, an exception (JobFailureError) is raised
            and an error message is logged with the underlying reason of the failure.

            If wait_for_response if False, A job ID (of type UUID) is returned that one
            can use to poll for the job completion and result with the

        Remove a set of GEMD objects.

        You may provide GEMD objects that reference each other, and the objects
        will be removed in the appropriate order.

        A failure will be returned if the object cannot be deleted due to an external
        reference.

        All data objects must be associated with this dataset resource. You must also
        have write access on this dataset.

        If you wish to delete more than 50 objects, queuing of deletes requires that
        the types of objects be known, and thus you _must_ provide ids in the form
        of BaseEntities.

        Also note that Attribute Templates cannot be deleted at present.

        Parameters
        ----------
        id_list: List[Union[LinkByUID, UUID, str, BaseEntity]]
            A list of the IDs of data objects to be removed. They can be passed
            as a LinkByUID tuple, a UUID, a string, or the object itself. A UUID
            or string is assumed to be a Citrine ID, whereas a LinkByUID or
            BaseEntity can also be used to provide an external ID.

        Returns
        -------
        List[Tuple[LinkByUID, ApiError]]
            A list of (LinkByUID, api_error) for each failure to delete an object.
            Note that this method doesn't raise an exception if an object fails to be
            deleted.
