    Parameters
    ----------
    job
        The job submission object or job ID that was given from a job submission.
    timeout
        Amount of time to wait on the job (in seconds) before giving up. Defaults

    polling_delay:
        How long to delay between each polling retry attempt.

        The job response information that can be used to extract relevant
